# Score Board API Documentation

## Overview

The Score Board API is responsible for managing and displaying user scores on the score board of the website. It provides endpoints for retrieving top scores, updating user scores, and ensuring security measures against unauthorized access.

## Base URL

## Endpoints

### 1. Retrieve Top 10 Scores

- **URL:** `/scores`
- **Method:** `GET`
- **Description:** Retrieves the top 10 user scores for display on the score board.
- **Response:**
  - Status Code: `200 OK`
  - Body: Array of objects representing top scores, each containing `userId`, `score`, and `timestamp` fields.

### 2. Update User Score

- **URL:** `/scores`
- **Method:** `POST`
- **Description:** Increases the user's score upon completion of a specific action.
- **Request Body:**
  - JSON Object:
    - `actionToken` (string): Token representing the completed action, obtained after the user completes all steps.
- **Response:**
  - Status Code: `200 OK` if the update is successful.
  - Status Code: `401 Unauthorized` if the user is not authorized to perform the update.

**Notes:**
- The `actionToken` is a token representing the completed action, obtained after the user completes all necessary steps.
- The action token uniquely identifies the action that triggered the score update.
- Upon providing a valid action token, the user's score will be increased.

### Live Scoreboard Update

To achieve live updates of the scoreboard, WebSocket communication will be implemented between the client (browser) and the server. This enables real-time transmission of score updates to all connected clients without the necessity of refreshing the page.

Implementation Steps:

1. **WebSocket Connection**: 
   - Upon visiting the website, the client establishes a WebSocket connection with the server.

2. **Server-side Setup**:
   - WebSocket support is required on the server
   - Upon receipt of a WebSocket connection request, the server accepts the connection and keeps track of connected clients.

3. **Server-side Processing**:
   - After updating the score in the database, the server broadcasts a WebSocket message to all connected clients containing the updated score data.

5. **Client-side Handling**:
   - Upon receipt of the WebSocket message from the server, each client updates the scoreboard in real-time without requiring a page refresh.
   - Client-side code should manage WebSocket events like `onopen`, `onmessage`, and `onclose` to handle connections and update the UI accordingly.

6. **Disconnect Handling**:
   - Logic should be implemented on both the client and server to gracefully handle WebSocket disconnections. This ensures that clients are removed from the list of connected clients when they close the browser or navigate away from the page.

  **Notes:**
  - Ensure WebSocket support on both client and server sides.
  - Implement error handling and fallback mechanisms for failed WebSocket connections.
  - Optimize WebSocket messages to transmit only necessary data, minimizing bandwidth usage.

## Security Considerations

- **Authorization:** Endpoints related to score updates require authorization to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Input Validation:** All incoming requests are validated to ensure data integrity and prevent malicious inputs.
- **Rate Limiting:** Rate limiting mechanisms are implemented to prevent abuse and protect the API from excessive requests.

## Additional Comments

- Caching mechanisms can be implemented to improve performance, especially for frequently accessed score data.
- Logging and monitoring solutions should be in place to track API usage and detect anomalies effectively.
